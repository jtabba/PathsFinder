# PathsFinder

A recursive algorithm used to determine how many possible paths exist within a metaphorical 'warehouse', represented by an array of 1's (open path) and 0's (blocked path). 

I completed this task during a coding challenge and found that it helped me understand recursive functions, and significantly developed my ability to implement them.

The biggest hurdle of the algorithm is efficiency and it timed out after 16 seconds during the challenge's tests. Potentially, I plan to implement memoization sometime in the future to optimise the code.
